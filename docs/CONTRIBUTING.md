# How to contribute

Before contributing, please read and adhere to the [GOV.UK Design System code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Here are some ways in which you can contribute:

## Discussing styles, components and patterns

You can discuss the work being developed here by commenting on issues via the [issues list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues) or [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1).

Examples of useful comments include:

- questions about a component or pattern
- answers to questions from other contributors
- examples or demos of a component or pattern
- research relating to a component or pattern
- offers to develop a component or pattern


## Proposing new styles, components or patterns

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new).

New issues will appear in the 'Proposed' column of the [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1).

The [Design System working group](WORKING_GROUP.MD) will review new issues every fortnight against the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md).

Issues that meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Agreed' column on the [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1).

Issues that do not meet the criteria will be moved to the 'Not doing' column on the [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1).


## Developing styles, components and patterns

Items in the 'Agreed' column of the [backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1) are ready to be developed.

If someone has been assigned to an item they will appear under the 'Assignees' section. Assigness are responsible for progressing the development of new styles, components and patterns. They may be doing the work themselves, or coordinating the contributions of others.

You can ask to be assigned to an issue by leaving a comment, or by emailing the [Design System Team](govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). The team will contact you for more information.

If you can no longer support the development of something, let the [Design System Team](govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) know and we'll arrange for someone else to be assigned to it.


## Publishing styles, components or patterns

If you're assigned to something and believe it's ready to be published, add a 'ready' label to it's issue. The Design System Team will review the issue and work with you to prepare it for assurance by the [Design System working group](WORKING_GROUP.md).

The working group will review the issue against the [Design System criteria](CRITERIA.md). Once the checklist has been met your work will be published in the Design System.
