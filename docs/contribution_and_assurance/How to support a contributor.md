# How to support a contributor of a new component or pattern

This guidance is for the GOV.UK Design System team. It explains how to support a contributor. 

If you are running a design system, you are welcome to reuse it. 

## Overview

This guidance explains the steps involved in supporting a contributor. It starts at the point when you pick up a contribution to support and finishes when the contribution is published. 

1. Organise a kick-off session
2. Book into a review session
3. Develop the contribution
4. Working group review session
5. Prepare to publish the contribution
6. Publish the contribution

## 1. Organise a kick-off session

Invite the contributor to a kick off session to discuss the contribution in detail. Kick-off sessions can be held in person or remotely, depending on the contributor’s preference.

### Before the session

Before the session, create a folder in the team's Contribution and assurance folder with the name of the contribution. Find out the following information and record it in a document, saved in that folder. 

- Is the contribution already in the backog? Is it in the ‘proposed’ or ‘to-do’ column? 
- How much work has been done?
- Is there a clear user need?
- Who from the team needs to attend the kick-off session? You must invite at least one interaction designer, one content designer and one frontend developer.
- Is the Design System the right place for that contribution? For example, the [Service Manual](gov.uk/service-manual) might be more appropriate for very high-level guidance.
- Where in the Design System would this contribution live? Is it a component or a pattern? How might it affect or relate to other content in the Design System?
- What dependencies might the contribution have, for example on Frontend? 
- Are there any obvious challenges or questions that need to be discussed with the contributor up front?

### During the session

Agree who will take notes during the meeting. Copy and paste the following agenda into a shared Google doc and use it to make notes.

### Contribution kick-off meeting agenda

#### 1. Overview of contribution process

- Working group 
- Review sessions 
- Timings
- Support 

#### 2. Agree acceptance criteria

Make a copy of the [acceptance criteria template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/blob/master/docs/contribution_and_assurance/Individual%20contribution%20acceptance%20criteria%20template.md) and update it to document what needs to be done for the contribution to be ready.

#### 3. Identify support needs

Note: the Design System team is there to support the contributor. Design, guidance, code and research are ultimately the responsibility of the contributor. If they need a lot of support, make sure the contributor understands that it will take longer to develop. 

#### 4. Next steps

If the contributor still wants to proceed, check if they’re happy to be named publicly as the contributor (for example, in Slack announcements and in GitHub issues).

Assign them to the relevant issue in the [Design System backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1) to confirm that they are working on it.

Estimate how much time the contribution will take to develop. 

Agree how the work will be developed, for example, in branches of GOV.UK Frontend and GOV.UK Design System, in the Prototype Kit, in the contributor’s own repo or in a Google Doc.

Book in a weekly slot to catch up, identifying any annual leave or busy weeks that need to be taken into consideration. 

---

### After the kick-off session

Share the acceptance criteria agreed in the kick-off session with the contributor to check.

Once they’ve confirmed they’re happy with the acceptance criteria, publish it in the GitHub issue.

You can refine it later but the basics should not change. 

## 2. Book into a review session

The [Design System working group](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group/) is a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from across government. Each month, representatives review new contributions and decide whether they are ready to be publish. 

Based on the agreed acceptance criteria and the amount of support needed, agree with the contributor which review session you’ll aim to have it ready for. 

Contributions are sent round to the working group 2 weeks before each review session. Therefore, the deadline for your work is 2 weeks before the review session you book into.

The best way to agree a date is to email the contributor with a list of the upcoming review session dates and contribution deadlines. You can check review session dates in the Design System Team Events calendar.

Suggest a timescale that you think seems realistic, and check if it sounds OK to them.

Once they’ve confirmed a date, let the facilitator for that session know.

## 3. Develop the contribution

While the contribution is being developed, you should be having weekly catch-up meetings with the contributor. In these meetings, record progress against each of the acceptance criteria, and note down what still needs to be done.

Follow each meeting with an email summarising the progress and next steps.

Create cards on [our sprint board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/4) to represent any work you agree. This will help you keep track of the work you are doing and make it visible for the rest of the team.

### Prepare the contribution for review

At least 3 weeks before the next working group review session, confirm to the person who’s facilitating it that the contribution will be ready.

**If the contribution will not be ready in time, you should tell the facilitator as soon as possible.**

Ask the contributor if they can make a branch and open a draft pull request for adding the contribution to the Design System. The Netlify preview it generates is what the working group uses to review the contribution. 

If they are not familiar with GitHub or not confident enough, offer to help them, or create the pull request yourself. 

At this point, arrange to have a ‘Pre-mortem’ with the contributor. This is a session where you brainstorm the reasons the contribution might not get approved for publication, and decide what you can do to address any risks you identify. 

Involve other members of the Design System team in this session, if you can.

### Send the contribution

When it’s ready to review (this must be at least 2 weeks before the working group review session), you should share a link to the contribution preview with the review session facilitator.

The facilitator will collect decisions and recommendations for the contribution and share these with you to discuss with the contributor before the review session.

## 4. Working group review session

The working group review session is a chance for the working group representatives to discuss their decisions and recommendations with each other and with contributors.

### Before the session

1. Check the date and time of the review session

The review session invitation is sent to the whole team, so it should be in your calendar. 

2. Invite the contributor to the session.

Contributors do not have to attend sessions if they don’t feel comfortable doing so. However, feedback from previous contributors and from the working group shows it’s useful for understanding the context of decisions and recommendations, and to have an opportunity to respond.  

If they are willing and able to attend, send them the calendar invite.

Likewise, you can choose to attend the review session or not, but for similar reasons, it’s recommended that you do.

3. Go through the decisions and recommendations.

The facilitator will send you the decisions and recommendations from the working group 1 week before the review session. You should book in some time to discuss these with the contributor.

Check that they understand the feedback they’ve been given, and help them prepare any responses they might need or want to give during the session.

### During the session

The facilitator will ask each representative to confirm their decision and talk through any recommendations they have made.

Although decisions and recommendations are sent ahead of the session, representatives can change their decision based on comments from other representatives, or the contributor, if they want to.

If both you and the contributor attend the session, let them speak for themselves as much as possible. If they are struggling, or it’s clear that they’ve forgotten something important, you can jump in, but ultimately you’re there to observe and support them, not to speak on their behalf.

### After the session

Summarise recommendations

Go through the session notes and write a summary of the recommendations. Do this by bullet-noting the recommendations under themed headings, for example, ‘Design’, ‘Code’, ‘Guidance’, ‘Research’.

1. Agree pre-publication steps

Book a meeting to discuss these with the Design System team and decide what work should be done before publication. 

If the working group voted that the contribution can be published as it is, it’s up to you to decide which, if any, of the recommendations should be addressed before publication.

If the group agreed that the contribution cannot be published until certain recommendations have been addressed, blocking recommendations must be dealt with before publication.

After the meeting, sort the recommendations in your summary into ‘pre-publication’ and ‘post-publication’ and send to the facilitator within 1 week of the review session.

### Example summary
---

Payment card details

#### Guidance


**Pre-publication:**

- explain that the card logos help users trust the service
- explain that showing all the logos helps users understand which cards are supported
- describe the behaviour of the card lookup feature when JavaScript is not available

**Post-publication:**

- add information about the range of users, browsers and assistive technology that the pattern has been tested with
- add accessibility criteria for the pattern
- explain when and how to to let browsers autofill a user’s card details

#### Design


**Post-publication:**

- consider more obvious ways of highlighting the chosen card logo
- provide the card logo images to help people implement the pattern

2. Plan next steps with the contributor

Share the recommendations with the contributor. Ask how much time can they dedicate to the work and where can we help out.

Create issues on our sprint board to represent the work and incorporate it into sprint planning.

## 5. Prepare to publish the contribution

Do the pre-publication work you’ve agreed. This might include some back and forth with the contributor.

Contributions involving new or iterated styles or components will need a pull request on the GOV.UK Frontend repo. 

Contributions involving patterns or updated guidance will need a pull request on the Design System repo. Some contributions will need both. 

Ask the contributor to raise draft pull requests if they haven’t yet. If they are not comfortable in doing this, ask for permission to do it yourself (make sure you also ask if they would like to be named or anonymised). 

## 6. Publish contribution

When the contribution is ready, take the pull request out of draft and request a review from someone in the team who has not worked with the contributor.

Once everyone's happy, you can merge the pull request.

You might have to have to do a release to GOV.UK Frontend and then one to the GOV.UK Design System to publish the contribution. Keep the contributor updated while this is happening, and let them know as soon as it’s published. 

### Let the community know

Post an announcement in the #govuk-design-system channel on Cross Government Slack and #govuk-design-system channel on GDS Slack about the new contribution.

For example, “We have a new contribution to the GOV.UK Design System! [NAME OF CONTRIBUTION] was contributed by [CONTRIBUTOR’S NAME] on [DATE], many thanks!”.
