# Email templates for sending new proposals and contributions to the working group

These templates are for the GOV.UK Design System team to send new proposals and contributions to the [Design System working group](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group/), ahead of the monthly review sessions. 

If you are running a design system, you are welcome to reuse them. 

You should email new proposals and contributions to the working group one week before each review session.
